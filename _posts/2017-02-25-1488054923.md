\\
just to be happy\\
looking at your door\\
Have you ever smoked;\\
Have you ever smoked;\\
And we can dance\\
I want a funeral

All in a mural\\
vowed to the fingernails\\
I want a funeral\\
But I can't see\\
I want to drill\\
Lost in the pulpit.

You are the dreamer\\
So I can be found\\
even at the party,\\
I'll take one more time\\
They a cute one\\
instead of the sun.

It can be found\\
It can be found\\
A day seems too long.\\
looking at your side\\
And all I got anything\\
But he was twenty

Read between the ohs\\
I can be found\\
Lifeless but not enough\\
even at the boy\\
Pinched up to a\\
heâ€™s all the same?
