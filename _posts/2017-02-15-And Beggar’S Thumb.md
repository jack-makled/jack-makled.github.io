I want to tell myself what I am.

but could not wait for a second longer.\\
she smiled when she told me I was then.\\
a shot in the back of a bed;\\
And no one made a change with our two best friends\\
But the stench of the defeated and the bottom of my aching body without

No matter what you believe,\\
When you realize its too late, and that beautiful fucking face\\
As the cat was strangled at the bit on popcorn kernels.\\

And that'll set the game can be resumed.\\
Fraying around the mouth.\\
as I emerge from the chasm in between\\
