## Sometimes I Can Taste That

---
\\
breathe out, there was not evil\\
being in my gut.\\
Viewers were enthralled, she was cold, I let the cool drips creep,\\
Drink Japanese tea out of hope instead of laziness.

Yet she does not follow the given prompt will be able to be my facts.\\
and who didn't care what they claim.\\
It’s only being able to be worshipped\\
don't let this be fake

A man awakes he has no bearing in science\\
I’m traveling incognito, on the couch, or you fucked me—\\
in my mind and I'm alone.\\
and imagine how they used to breathe.

And In times of need he did hurt me\\
intertwined in the ruins of a fading vibrance\\
And the gods that spurned this darkest hour\\
drawing us to the sunshine

Since my baby blue has gone away\\
Sorry for the baby,\\
desperate for the long dreams\\
A game to her, - to me.
