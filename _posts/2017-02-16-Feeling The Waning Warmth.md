## Feeling The Waning Warmth

---
\\
I see red rain.If for but a one floor deed,\\
Maybe now that I might wholly unwind\\
and for my tardiness!\\
he does not follow the given prompt will be able to break out of view.\\
and we laugh and bow about, knowing it will come when time demands\\
Or perhaps age is the real Judas\\
How could I have a lifetime’s pass

She surely will come down too\\
I bled out, a few states away,\\
clinging to a window,\\
because I was no heat\\
Twitching the veil on the plaza in lieu of a bed;\\
she smiled when she told me that travel is stupid\\
All i can feel me

or if you stare\\
It’s been a long time\\
This soft world of dew\\
The throat of your curls and my firmly attached head\\
Blindfolded, behold it, for it will regale only us.\\
when I feel overcome, and I learned to stop crying in my crib, and silence.\\
you spend so much nonsense.
