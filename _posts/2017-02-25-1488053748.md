\\
will I wake up.\\
Shot in the forum.\\
Drown me in chains\\
Just how I never knew

Performing how I never knew\\
I want a funeral\\
On which it develops\\
It’s time to take

It’s time to time—\\
just to be safe\\
between you, and the end.\\
Until the night passes

It is a liar.\\
And we can dance\\
A remnant of the Earth,\\
They want to tremble
