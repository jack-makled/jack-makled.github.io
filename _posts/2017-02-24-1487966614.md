\\
You made me what I learned.\\
and all the things I'd hear?\\
do not know who made me doubt my feelings,\\
we could be a bum\\
The riptide is a field.\\
worn like a thick

because I knew it\\
Remnants on the air.\\
Im blinded as I used to breathe.\\
At first, naively, I thought who am I,\\
Drown me in distress.\\
Wait and wait for a second longer.

The world were to be by your side.\\
just to be so reviled;\\
If you could too when I sigh, and kiss\\
up from the outside.\\
as they came with daybreak\\
Rainbows of a seat.
