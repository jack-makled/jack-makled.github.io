Shed of this line:\\
That I know the word human\\
on an empty god.\\
to all the same?\\
Drown me in chains\\
If you have on\\
raiding with the knife.

They a cute one\\
Hung from a time\\
Lifeless but not enough\\
just to be happy\\
heâ€™s all the same?\\
Read between the ohs\\
A remnant of the world today

For it was him,\\
crashing into my eyes.\\
Hidden in the grass.\\
Anger of the Earth,\\
Lifeless but not enough\\
Returning to the top or\\
And in my head.

Drown me in chains\\
Away from the narrows,\\
dynamite on the stage.\\
There is a waste\\
But I can't see\\
Condemn them to know.\\
just to be your

and he was twenty\\
And we can dance\\
But you can see\\
Lifeless but not enough\\
Every piece of content.\\
Wielded as a result?\\
I want to drill
