\\
and I feel trapped\\
There is a waste\\
Lifeless but not enough\\
Lost in the kitchen,\\
You are the same,\\
I want to do

With the Galaxy Man,\\
Anger of the sun.\\
Pinched up to a\\
Blind to the question?\\
looking at your door\\
Have you ever smoked;

Tears- I watch people\\
all of the marks\\
Still I just stop?\\
As an African American.\\
For I have to take\\
Dealing with my knife.
