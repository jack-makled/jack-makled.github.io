## You're neat

---
\\
Create a state, static in weight, and no one but himself to blame\\
and I would scribble paintings

The circle, the dot, the start and the car is swerving\\
as if they were the last day we had been

and I feel overcome, and I would glimpse you.\\
and who didn't care what they thought anyway.
